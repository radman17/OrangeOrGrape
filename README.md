# OrangeOrGrape

🍊 or 🍇

Welcome to the game! Here's a quick guide to help you get started:


 - The objective of the game is to fill the pitcher with the chosen juice before the other pitcher fills up with juice. 

 - To begin, choose between orange and grape juice. There are two glasses in front of you, one filled with orange juice and the other with grape juice. There are also two pitchers, one for orange juice and the other for grape juice.

 - Click on one of the glasses to reveal whether the liquid in that glass is the chosen juice or the non-chosen juice. The content of the glass you clicked on will then go into the corresponding pitcher.

 - Each time you click on a glass, it will fill 1/10 of the pitcher. and then you have to refill them again by clicking on Refill button.


😁 Good luck and have fun playing!
